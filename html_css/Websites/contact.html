<h1>XHTML Intro</h1>

<p style="color:green; font-size=15px;>Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated.

While HTML, prior to HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.

XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML adaptation of the HTML5 specification.[1][2]</p>



<h3>XHTML overview</h3>

<a name="overview">XHTML 1.0 is "a reformulation of the three HTML 4 document types as applications of XML 1.0".[3] The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) also continues to maintain the HTML 4.01 Recommendation, and the specifications for HTML5 and XHTML5 are being actively developed. In the current XHTML 1.0 Recommendation document, as published and revised to August 2002, the W3C commented that, "The XHTML family is the next step in the evolution of the Internet. By migrating to XHTML today, content developers can enter the XML world with all of its attendant benefits, while still remaining confident in their content's backward and future compatibility."[3]

However, in 2005, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) formed, independently of the W3C, to work on advancing ordinary HTML not based on XHTML. The WHATWG eventually began working on a standard that supported both XML and non-XML serializations, HTML5, in parallel to W3C standards such as XHTML 2. In 2007, the W3C's HTML working group voted to officially recognize HTML5 and work on it as the next-generated HTML standard.[4] In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2 Working Group's charter to expire, acknowledging that HTML5 would be the sole next-generation HTML standard, including both XML and non-XML serializations.[5] Of the two serializations, the W3C suggests that most authors use the HTML syntax, rather than the XHTML syntax.[6]</a>


<h2>XHTML Motivation</h2>

<p class="motivation">XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and increase interoperability with other data formats.[7] HTML 4 was ostensibly an application of<span class="spantag"> Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</span>; however the specification for SGML was complex, and neither web browsers nor the HTML 4 Recommendation were fully conformant to it.[8] The XML standard, approved in 1998, provided a simpler data format closer in simplicity to HTML 4.[9] By shifting to an XML format, it was hoped HTML would become compatible with common XML tools;[10] servers and proxies would be able to transform content, as necessary, for constrained devices such as mobile phones.[11] By using namespaces, XHTML documents could provide extensibility by including fragments from other XML-based languages such as Scalable Vector Graphics and MathML.[12] Finally, the renewed work would provide an opportunity to divide HTML into reusable components (XHTML Modularization) and clean up untidy parts of the language.[13]</p>
